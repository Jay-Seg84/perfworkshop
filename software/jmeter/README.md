# Installing JMeter
The easiest way to get JMeter is to download the binary.
You can find it at https://jmeter.apache.org/download_jmeter.cgi

It is always recommended to download the latest version but some elements may not work on newer versions.

Note: You need JVM or JDK installed to run JMeter.

## Steps
- Download the Binary in the zip file.
- Unzip the content in your defined folder
